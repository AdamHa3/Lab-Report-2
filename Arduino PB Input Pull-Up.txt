/*  

Arduino PB (PB) Input Pull-Up program code 

The goal of the program is to detect the state of a push button (PB) using an internal pull-up resistor. When the button is pressed, its value should be 0, and when it is not pressed, its value should be 1, just like the standard Arduino pull-up configuration but with an internal resistor instead of an external one.

Theme: Digital Input

int pushButton = 7; // Pin 7 of the Arduino is assigned to the push button (PB).

 
 

// The setup function runs once when the board powers on or is reset.

void setup() {   

 
 

pinMode(pushButton,INPUT); //PB is set as a Input   

 
 

Serial.begin(9600); //Create connection to the serial monitor 

}   

 
 

// The loop function runs again and again forever.   

void loop() {   

  

int buttonState = digitalRead(pushButton); //read the value of PB as buttonstate   

 
 

Serial.print("buttonState = "); //prints onto the serial monitor " buttonState = "   

 
 

Serial.println(buttonState); //displays the value of buttonState and moves to a new line on the Serial Monitor.

 
 

delay(1); //gives a delay of 1ms in between each print in the serial monitor
